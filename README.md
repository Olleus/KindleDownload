# KindleDownload
A selenium script to download your entire Amazon ebooks library while it is still allowed.


Requires python and selenium, as well as firefox.

Run the script from a terminal, and tell it which URL to start downloading from. It will open a browser to that page. Once you've logged in, press any key in the terminal and the script will download all content it can find to the default download location.
