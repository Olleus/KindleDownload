# KindleDownload
A selenium script to download your entire Amazon ebooks library while it is still allowed.


The .py script requires python and selenium, as well as firefox. The .exe is a standalone version of the same code packaged using pyinstaller, it only requires firefox.

Running either version will ask the user to input the URL to their amazon kindle library in a terminal window. It will then open a browser to that page; once you've logged in press any key in the terminal and it will download all content it can find to the browser's default download location.
