# KindleDownload
A selenium script to download your entire Amazon ebooks library while it is still allowed.


The .py script requires python and selenium, as well as firefox. The .exe is a standalone version of the same code packaged using pyinstaller, it only requires firefox.

Running either version will ask the user to input the URL to their amazon kindle library in a terminal window. It will then open a browser to that page; once you've logged in press any enter in the terminal and it will download all content it can find to the browser's default download location.


UPDATE 2025-02-21:
Adapted to slight changes done by Amazon.
More robust error handling.
Option to start at a later page in library.

FINAL UPDATE
The planned changes at amazon having taken place, this code can no longer work. Closing project.
